This evening we will talk about devops on AWS, the use of interfaces and how to properly use websockets. The event is hosted at Studi's headquarter in the center of Stockholm. Studi creates multilingual educations for high school students. Read more about them at their website: https://www.studi.se/\n\n## The talks\n\n### Setting up AWS infrastructure and automated CI for PHP by Yassin Makhloufi\n\nStarting a new job as a developer, one usually finds an existing working infrastructure and a CI pipeline in place including a (hopefully) easy-to-setup development environment as well as a production and possibly some staging environments. Many developers never have to face the situation in which they have to do this terribly ops-ish work.\n\nIn this talk we will see a live demo of how to:\n- set up a basic auto-scaling infrastructure with the help of AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n- do automated testing, linting and code sniffing on git-push using Codeship\n- automatically deploy the application package from Codeship to AWS\n\n### The interface is dead, long live the interface! by Niklas Modess\n\nA tale from the authoritarian Kingdom of Laravel. For long the \"elders\" in the community have preached the gospel of interfaces and how we can switch out implementations with a single line of code. This has been interpreted as \"do it for everything\". It's time to kill the interface to bring it back to life.\n\n### Plug it into the socket by Filip Joelsson\n\nFilip is going to show us how to use websockets as an alternative to HTTP-based interfaces. It will be a hands on demonstration showing how to connect a simple React/Redux based client to a PHP-based server, with some tips and tricks as we go.\n\nFilip is a self employed consultant in full-stack web development.\n\n## Schedule\n17.30: Doors open\n18.10: Settin up AWS infrastructure and automated CI for PHP - Yassin Makhloufi\n18.25: Break\n18.50: The interface is dead, long live the interface! - Niklas Modess\n19.10: Plug it into the socket - Filip Joelsson\n20.00: We go to a bar close by\n\n## This meetup is a paid event\nWe are trying something new here. We charge 29 SEK and are doing that for two reasons:\n\n- We want to be able to buy giveaways like stickers, books, and T-shirts\n- We want to have a budget to pay for speakers from other countries\n\nWe will not pay any salary to the organizers.

Every week, 2-10 entrepreneurs will meet in the same location, discuss their biggest challenges and ways to overcome them. They will also commit to goals for the next week. This group requires confidentiality, willingness to both give and receive advice, and readiness to support each other with respect and honesty. We hope some of you will regard the Masterminds as your new community and continue to show up on a weekly basis.\n\nIf everyone who signed up can please introduce your project and the main challenge you want to discuss this week in the comments, it would be great. Everyone who comments, and attends this event at least once a month, will be also featured on the StartupBlink blog!\n\nThe first person commenting will be this week’s mastermind leader. This means assuming the responsibility to pick the table for the group and make sure you find each other (if you can share your name and whatsapp number in the comment it would be great - so people can find you). The mastermind leaders receive a special perk as our brave volunteers, and get their project description and link featured on this event and also on our blog! Want to be a permanent leader for the group? Great!\nEmail [masked] to let us know! We'll put your name and project as the permanent leader, and you can also choose your own location, day and time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSmall masterminds are the best! If you have more than 5 people attending, split into two groups.\nEach participant receives 15 minutes to do the following:\n1) A short, 2-minute introduction of your business and current major challenge.\n2) An open discussion about this challenge with the group (about 10 minutes).\n3) Setting goals for next week (and discussing results of your goals from last week, if you attended the previous session) in the remaining time.\n\nAfter the groups have finished, there will be time for networking with the other groups."},{"title":"GraphTour Stockholm","date":1520496000000,"city":"Stockholm","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Friends-of-Neo4j-Stockholm/events/246074990","description":"Neo4j is hitting the road to bring a full day of content-rich sessions on how graph databases are revolutionising the modern enterprise.

Nima is focusing on supporting sales, service and customer satisfaction in combination with increased automation and efficiency by leveraging cutting edge machine learning and deep learning applications within the domain of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\n## 6:20 Building Classification Models from Rules and Crowdsourced Data by Veronika Plotnikova\n\nTransaction data is one of the most important source of information for understanding customer needs, providing relevant product recommendations, etc. Naturally, categorization of customer transactions is topic widely addressed by financial institutions as they deal with large number of payments originated by customers every day. Many banks still rely on traditional rule-based systems for automatic labelling of the transactions, however, they can be improved by applying machine learning. We tackled transaction categorization problem as multiclass classification task by applying XGBoost algorithm, and tested our approach on a large scale, anonymized, crowdsourced dataset. **Veronika Plotnikova** is part of Customer Intelligence Swedbank team. She is professional with 15 years advanced analytics experience gained across various financial institutions. Her professional (and research) area of interest is practical application of various advanced analytics solutions for business value creation within organizations.\n\n## 6:45 Data Discovery and Data Protection through Pseudonymization by Max Boreback &amp; Håkan Jonsson As a part of our enterprise data landscape, we provide an R&amp;D platform for quick access to data, quick insigts and with the goal of finding those nuggets of data that can turn into gold mines. In the R&amp;D environment, called Data Discovery Platform, it is important to be able to play with the data without being limited by sensitive information. To make the information more freely available we use pseudonymization to remove sensitive information but at the same time preserve the ability to join data sets on the sensitive fields. Kylo &amp; Nifi is some of our tools we use for data ingestion, which enables us to provide self-service functionality for ingestion of data.\n\nMax and Håkan will share the big data journey regarding the platform and data privacy **Max Börebäck**, is a Senior Data Engineer at Swedbank, Group Business Intelligence, with strong DevOps automation and Security expertise. He is one of the principal engineers developing and tuning the Data Discovery Platform.\n\n**Håkan Jonsson**, is working as a BI Solution architect at Swedbank and is the project architect for the big data initiatives at Group Business Intelligence, Infrastructure and Architecture. He has a special interest in creating a unified data architecture and data platforms that can help all the enterprise utilize all the data we have.\n\n## 7:15 Necessary tools to perform decent large scale deep learning by Davit Bzhalava\n\n**Davit Bzhalava** is a Sr. Data Scientist at analytics development team of Swedbank's CVM.

Presto was designed and written from the ground up for interactive analytics and approaches the speed of commercial data warehouses while scaling to the size of organizations like Facebook. One key feature in Presto is the ability to query data where it lives via an uniform ANSI SQL interface. Presto’s connector architecture creates an abstraction layer for anything that can be represented in a columnar or row-like format, such as HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure Storage, NoSQL stores, relational databases, Kafka streams and even proprietary data stores. Furthermore, a single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analytics across an entire organization.\n\nThis talk will be co-presented by Wojciech Biela and Piotr Findeisen from Starburst, the enterprise Presto company, largest contributor to Presto outside of Facebook. The talk will be a gentle introduction to Presto and its ability to query virtually any data source via it’s connector interface. Wojciech and Piotr will present some of the use cases of Presto querying various data sources, discuss the existing connectors in Presto, and describe the backing architectural concepts.\n\nSpeakers:\nWojciech Biela is a co-founder of Starburst and is responsible for product development. He has a background of over 13 years of building products and running engineering teams. Previously Wojciech was the Engineering Manager at the Teradata Center for Hadoop, running the Presto engineering operations in Warsaw, Poland. Prior to that, back in 2011, he built and ran the Polish engineering team, a subsidiary of Hadapt Inc., a pioneer in the SQL-on-Hadoop space. Hadapt was acquired by Teradata in 2014. Earlier, Wojciech built and lead teams on multi-year projects, from custom big e-commerce &amp; SCM platforms to PoS systems. Wojciech holds a M.S. in Computer Science from the Wroclaw University of Technology.\n\nPiotr Findeisen is a Software Engineer and a founding member of the Starburst team.

The agenda and speaker information can be found below. See you there!\n\n-----\n\nAgenda:\n5:30pm: Doors open\n5:30pm - 6:00pm: Networking and Drinks\n6:00pm - 6:40pm: Ooyala Adtech: Liberating Data Streams with Kafka and Friends, Stanislav Chizhov, Oolaya Adtech\n6:40pm - 7:10pm: Q&amp;A, Networking, Pizza and Drinks\n7:10pm - 7:50pm: Kafka story @ Klarna, Ivan Dyachkov, Klarna\n7:50pm - 8:30pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking\n-----\nTitle:\nOoyala Adtech: Liberating Data Streams with Kafka and Friends Abstract:\nIn Ooyala Adtech we have 1B+ ad events per day to be collected, delivered in near real-time to tens of different consumers, which include ad server decision engine itself, forecasting, reporting and more. We used to run it on RabbitMQ and a home-built blob storage, but it was not reliable enough, had high operation costs and made onboarding new data streams difficult. Recently we have completed replacing it with new Kafka-based solution, which we does not have the above mentioned limitations.We have switched all the consumers and changed messaged format to Avro and now we are using quite a lot from Kafka ecosystem: Kafka Streams, Google PubSub connector, S3 Connector, Schema registry and Mirror Maker and soon K-SQL and Debezium. For some of the stateful consumers we had to implement backup/restore of event topics to/from S3.\n\nSpeaker:\nStanislav Chizhov\n\nBio:\nStanislav is a software engineer in Ooyala Adtech, where he develops a data delivery backbone and ecosystem with the ultimate goal to make creating and processing arbitrary data streams a commodity. He works mostly with Kafka technology stack and Java\n\n-----\n\nSpeaker:\nIvan Dyachkov\n\nBio:\nIvan has been leading Kafka initiative at Klarna for 3 years from the start. Right now he's a Team Lead for Servicing Reliability team and is gradually transferring ownership of Kafka infrastructure to another team.\n\nTitle:\nKafka story @ Klarna\n\nAbstract:\nOur love story with Kafka at Klarna is very similar. We felt the pain of running numerous RabbitMQ clusters throughout the organization and when Kafka caught our attention we decided to try it out.\nFast forward 2 years – Kafka has become a universal transport for pretty much everything. Events, metrics, database transactions – if your new service needs to produce or consume some data, the answer is always \"just use Kafka\".\nWe'll talk about our journey with Kafka, which challenges did we have, why we reinvented some tools and what are the company-wide guidelines regarding message formats and Kafka usage.\n\n--------\n\nSpecial thanks to Oolaya Adtech http://www.ooyala.com/ who are hosting us for this event.\n\nDon't forget to join our Community Slack Team !\nIf you would like to speak or host our next event please let us know!

Some knowledge of Docker will be useful here but not essential.\n\nWe will see what architectural patterns FaaS enables and encourages and how we can use it as a platform to build larger applications.
