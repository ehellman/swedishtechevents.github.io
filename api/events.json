The RIoT Accelerator Program (RAP) facilitates entrepreneurship end-to-end from academic research and education through to rapid commercial growth. RAP increases the impact of traditional accelerator programming by partnering startups with an industry consortium of more than 60 companies across the IoT value chain. Industry seeds the accelerator with market-driven problems they are motivated to solve through entrepreneurial partnerships. Partners provide access to complimentary resources and seed investor capital necessary to launch new products and services to market.</p> <p>Margaret McNab will join Tom for this session to talk about the relationship between three specific growth-related terms: authenticity, focus and process. Margaret McNab helps companies grow. A marketer by profession and anthropologist by education, Margaret's approach to business growth is decidedly human centered. She develops marketing strategies that help companies work to their unique strengths, amplify culture and attract customers.

This pattern is an important part of an approach called Risk Adaptive Access Control (RADAC). One RADAC strategy that is enabled by policy-based authorization is leveraging machine learning to authorize actions based on behavior patterns as well as environmental factors. This allows developers to implement non-functional security features such as recognizing when critical data is being scraped by a script or a user manipulating data in a suspicious manner. In this session, we will review the concepts behind RADAC, and show real-world scenarios where it can be applied using Azure Machine Learning and policy-based authorization in ASP.Net Core MVC.</p> <p>Presenter: Michael Meadows</p> <p>Michael has been a professional programmer and architect for fifteen years, and a hacker for much longer. He has served as architect on multiple large-scale, cloud-based, highly regulated application and infrastructure projects.

This talk will explain the sorts of problems that can be solved, what data is required to solve them, and what the results look like. And, we’ll explore it using fun and geeky examples. We will cover six major types of problems that machine learning can solve: regression, forecasting, impact analysis, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.

Podstawowym przeznaczeniem takich skryptów jest automatyzacja pewnych powtarzalnych operacji lub osiągnięcie działań, które nie są możliwe przy użyciu wbudowanych funkcji programu. Za pomocą VBA możemy połączyć się z SQL Server co znacznie poszerza jego zastosowania.</p> <p>Na początek Robert zaprezentuje podstawy języka VBA w arkuszu kalkulacyjnym pakietu Office. Następnie pokaże jak połączyć się z poziomu VBE (Visual Basic Editor) z SQL Server i uruchamiać skrypty. Na koniec postara się odpowiedzieć na pytanie: \"Czy mając do dyspozycji Self-service BI w Excel'u, potrzebne nam jeszcze VBA?\"</p> <p>Widoki w SQL Server</p> <p>Sesja dla osób początkujących w SQL Server i języku T-SQL oraz dla tych, które chcą sobie przypomnieć to, o czym wiedziały, a zapomniały.

Będzie także parę minut o tym, jak użycie widoków przyspieszyło zapytania w realnym środowisku.

The concept was simple: students could get access to a platform with notes from everyone in their class. All they had to do was share their own notes.<br/>Long story short, Mathias graduated with a perfect score without ever taking a single note.<br/>He sold the company the subsequent year, making that his first exit at age 15.</p> <p>✌🏼 Company No. 2: From tutoring app to raising $1M from Angel Investors</p> <p>Before starting university at Oxford, Mathias launched a second company called Teech. Within 2 weeks, 3000 university students had signed up to join as Teechers and monetize their idle time by helping high school students with their work. He went on to raise just under 1M USD of angel investment that year.</p> <p>👌🏼 Company No. 3: Advising high-fashion companies</p> <p>While still being a student, Mathias co-founded Lawrence Parker, a Gen Z digital media consultancy which advises high-fashion companies on their social media presence and influencer strategy.</p> <p>💰 Side project: Managing a fund<br/>If what you read so far seems unbelievable, Mathias also runs a side-fund investing 1m+ per year in early stage startups.</p> <p>🙈 Wait... there's more?!</p> <p>I think you get the picture, Mathias never gets bored lol.<br/>He's been awarded an academic scholarship from Wadham College, University of Oxford for the entirety of his studies.<br/>He's worked as a Derivatives &amp; Futures analyst at a prestigious NYC hedge fund. He now works at The Family where he invests in startups and advises them on strategy &amp; growth and participates in the building of companies which increase the quality of the ecosystem infrastructure.</p> <p>Don't miss out, bring your friends, and see you there!</p>"},{"title":"91.

Furthermore, with a large shortage of developers, companies need to find innovative ways to recruit, and Honeypot solves these dilemmas. Before a developer gets accepted to Honeypot, there is a short verification process that includes a code review from open source contributions, such as GitHub, or with an additional coding challenge. This ensures a baseline quality level to every developer on the platform, which makes the search process more efficient for employers. On the other end, developers are able to select the interviews, offers and contracts according to their needs. The user profiles on the platform focus on these details and include a desired salary, location, information about preferred languages and even an option to work remote.

To do the setup, see the Reason website: reasonml.github.io (and post a comment if you run into any problems).

Or are you wanting to figure out how many encounters your players will make it through in an evening so you can prepare enough material?</p> <p>These important questions can all be answered using machine learning.</p> <p>Many developers want to make use of machine learning in their applications but aren’t sure what sorts of problems can be solved with it. This talk will explain the sorts of problems that can be solved, what data is required to solve them, and what the results look like. And, we’ll explore it using fun and geeky examples. We will cover six major types of problems that machine learning can solve: regression, forecasting, impact analysis, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. When we’re done, you’ll have a basic understanding of what machine learning can do and what you might want to use it for. I might even be something other than role-playing!</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Guy Royse (@guyroyse) works for Nexosis in Columbus, Ohio as a Developer Evangelist.

For best results, familiarity with basic vectors and matrices, inner (aka \"dot\") products of vectors, and rudimentary Python is definitely helpful.

Simply put, ICO is a similar play and stands for Initial Coin Offering.</p> <p>With the advent of blockchain technology, we are now able to make trustless transactions without requiring intermediary parties. The technology itself is a big step towards solving the issue of digital trust.</p> <p>Given this advancement, technology startups are now turning towards blockchain technology in order to raise funds from people around the world. This is an exciting development in crowdsourcing projects and means people can now invest in upcoming startups with few limitations.</p> <p>Startups that do initial coin offerings basically accept cryptocurrencies in exchange for token sales. These tokens are technically a lot like shares (not legally) and investors buy them in hopes of future profits as the prices of these tokens go up.</p> <p>The last twelve months saw ICOs raising over $2.5 billion and creating many millionaires in the process — hence the hype.</p> <p>Open discussion to learn and teach about the hottest space.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p><br/>• Important to know</p>"},{"title":"Разбор кода студентов по структурам данных ★★","date":1521036600000,"city":"Киев","link":"https://www.meetup.com/HowProgrammingWorks/events/247753734"},{"title":"Building Scalable Web Applications Using Micro-Services Architecture","date":1521037800000,"city":"Dubai","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Astrolabs-Digital-Tech/events/248463756","description":"<p>Proper architecture is needed in building enterprise web applications to ensure that it is easily scalable and developers productivity is high.

It uses hashing and a concept similar to salting to continuously complete blocks of information that chain to form an immutable ledger.</p> <p>Hashing is the act of mapping data of any length to a fixed-length output. When cryptography is involved it’s a one-way function. The most popular hashing algorithm is SHA-256, which outputs at a length of 256 bits. Every hash value is unique. Even the tiniest alteration to the data being hashed caused the entire value to change.</p> <p>Hashing is considered one-way because of the amount of computing power it would take to reverse-hash it. For a 256-bit output, calculate 2 to the power of 256 (2 X 2 X 2… 256 times). Your odds of finding the correct value are 1 in… the product of that equation. Those are astronomical odds. It would take a supercomputer thousands of years to compute that.</p> <p>Blockchain + Cryptocurrency</p> <p>Now let’s fit it all together. With a cryptocurrency blockchain, as transactions occur they are broadcast and added to various private ledgers. Each one of these transactions is digitally signed for the sake of authenticity. On the other end, there are people or groups collecting these transactions and building ledgers. They are also computing to find a value that when hashed along with the ledger, produces a set number of 0s at the beginning of the hash value. That’s the portion that’s similar to salting.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Be Sober - We serve coffee.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This is a Roundtable Discussion Meetup.

But *writing* concurrent programs is complicated, intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.</p> <p>Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and straightforward too? I think so. By carefully analyzing usability pitfalls in other libraries, and taking advantage of new Python 3 features, I've come up with a new set of primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs, and implemented them in a new library called [Trio](<a href=\"https://trio.readthedocs.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://trio.readthedocs.io</a>).

With them an attacker can read any location in memory and extract secret content at high rates. The attacks are unique because they gain access not by exploiting some bug in application or kernel code, but through a fundamental architecture design flaw in most modern commercial CPUs. Working around the flaw reliably can cost a third or more of program performance.</p> <p>The key word above is \"most.\" General purpose CPUs today commonly use Out of Order (OOO) scheduling and speculative execution to obtain higher performance. Unfortunately, Spectre and Meltdown have revealed that the increase in speed provided by OOO comes with an inherent cost: total loss  of security.</p> <p>However, not all CPUs use the OOO architecture. Many low-end architectures that are more concerned with power usage than speed use an older approach, In-Order (IO), and eschew speculation. Such chips are inherently immune to Meltdown/Spectre. In fact, the microcode workarounds applied to OOO machines to prevent these attacks in effect convert them into IO machines — that run at In-Order speed while using OOO power to do it.</p> <p>There is an exception to this gloomy news. The Mill architecture was designed from the beginning to provide OOO performance on an IO power budget. It does no hardware speculation and so, serendipitously, is immune to Meltdown and Spectre. That's the easy part — a Z80 does no hardware speculation and is immune too. The hard part is getting the performance that OOO used to have, but now must give up.</p> <p>The talk will describe the Meltdown and Spectre attacks, how and why they affect OOO machines, and why IO machines are immune. It will finish with a description of the architectural features that give the Mill the performance of speculation — without speculation.</p> <p><i>Ivan Godard is CTO and a founder of Mill Computing, Inc., developer of the Mill family of general-purpose CPUs. He has written or led the development team for a dozen compilers, an OS, an OODBMS, and much other software.

This month we welcome Sau Sheong Chang (the GopherCon SG organizer and Managing Director at Singapore Power) and Ahmad Muzakki (a Software Engineer at Tokopedia) to share their knowledge with the Jakarta development community on building Genetic Algorithms and GraphQL systems with Go.</p> <p>Presentations will begin promptly at 7:00pm, and will end at roughly 8:30pm. There will be a short question and answer period after each presenter. Doors open at 6:30pm. Please come on time, before 7:00pm!</p> <p>SPACE IS LIMITED! Please ensure you RSVP at EventBrite!</p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKERS AND TALKS:</p> <p>Sau Sheong \"Codefather\" Chang is a prominent engineer, author, and an active contributor in the Southeast Asia software development community. Sau Sheong is currently leading the digital revolution at Singapore Power (SP), and is the organizer behind GopherCon Singapore and was involved in the Go and Ruby communities in Singapore. Sau Sheong has written a number of books covering a variety of programming topics in Go and Ruby, and has a series of popular articles on Go. Sau Sheong previously led tech teams at PayPal, Yahoo, HP Labs, and Garena (now Sea) building systems leveraging every programming language, framework, platform, and technology under the sun. Sau Sheong's talk will cover a brief introduction to genetic algorithms and how they can be implemented in Go.</p> <p>Ahmad \"Jeki\" Muzakki is a Software Engineer at Tokopedia working on large-scale, backend APIs in Go. Jeki will cover building GraphQL systems with Go, and introduce concepts unique to working with GraphQL/Go, and share how Tokopedia is leveraging Go and GraphQL today. Previously, Jeki worked as an independent developer, and has deep experience with end-to-end applications connecting mobile (Android) and web frontends via REST, GraphQL, and other APIs to services written in Go, Java, and Node.js. Ahmad works daily on the Transactions team at Tokopedia, and has been building Go-based APIs since late 2015.</p> <p>ABOUT GOJAKARTA:</p> <p>GoJakarta is a monthly meetup group focused on examining applications, frameworks, and technologies written in the Go programming language. The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.</p>"},{"title":"Работа со строками, шаблонами и юникодом ★","date":1521123000000,"city":"Киев","link":"https://www.meetup.com/HowProgrammingWorks/events/247753754"},{"title":"GCP Live - Customer Story - Channable","date":1521126000000,"city":"San Bruno","link":"https://www.meetup.com/GCPOnline/events/246423585","description":"<p>Please accept our apologies for the reschedule due to an issue on our side.</p> <p>Channable.com is the ultimate product feed management tool.

Wspomni też o tym jak w praktyce wygląda bycie pierwszymi w Polsce, którzy taki klaster zbudowali. Dowiecie się jak działa mechanizm storage'owy tego rozwiązania i czym różni się ono od standardowych podejść jakie wszyscy znamy. Usłyszycie o mechanizmach Windows Server 2016, które pomogą w zarządzaniu klastrem jako takim oraz jak - przeważnie z pomocą PowerShella - ogarniać rzeczywistość S2D. Jeśli wszystko pójdzie dobrze - wykorzystując nową funkcjonalność nested virtualization - zobaczycie konfigurowanie takiego klastra.</p> <p>Paweł jest zwolennikiem teorii głoszonej przez Jacka Walkiewicza, że najwspanialsze projekty rodzą się w sercu, a nie w głowie.

It is a convenient, fast and open-for-everyone way to get support for a project. But just like in many revolutionary ideas, the initial concept has some serious flaws and need to be adjusted to become more usable and effective.</p> <p>Qualifying ICOs; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</p> <p>Why are there so few genuinely good ICOs are coming forward? Is it because this new means of raising capital is attracting a greater number of inexperienced, first time entrepreneurs that think they can raise the odd $10m on the strength of a ‘White Paper’? Let’s explore how we can identify the genuinely Good projects, and use a few of the Bad and the Ugly ones to familiarize ourselves with red flags.</p> <p>The Fundamentals of a Token Model What does it take to make a great token?</p> <p>The fundamentals of the token model are valuable and powerful. They allow communities to govern themselves, their economics, and rally a community in powerful ways that will allow open systems to flourish in a way that was previously impossible.</p> <p>Meet the ICOs</p> <p>PLEASE CONTACT US PRESENT YOUR ICO Marketing and Sales; Bringing the potential of an ICO to life</p> <p>Over the last year, we have seen a number of highly successful ICOs, from which we can take away some valuable entrepreneurial and marketing lessons. Let’s explore the importance of timing, community marketing, transparency, scarcity, and trust in this session about how to market your token sale.</p> <p>Convergence: the exciting future with Blockchain, AI, Robotics, IoT and other emerging technologies</p> <p>Forecasting: Determining the valuation of a token sale</p> <p>Many leading banks today rely on Artificial Intelligence-based algorithms to predict the performance of an asset — even markets as a whole. But up until now, AI technologies are mostly proprietary which benefit only the big firms. It is mostly inaccessible to the general public. In this session we will explore what tools are available for forecasting upcoming ICOs, from AI technologies to investor collectives and their valuation methods</p> <p>VC and the Cryptocurrency Revolution… Engage or Deny ICOs?</p> <p>Over the last year, numerous prestigious VC-firms such as 500 Startups, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures, have indulged in the rapidly expanding world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Let’s discover why the extreme liquidity of the ICO marketplace attracts more and more traditional investors to the Crypto Economy.</p> <p>ICO 2.0; Tokenizing ecosystems in existing industries</p> <p>In this session we’re taking a look at a development we have seen evolving over the last few months. More and more traditional companies, with existing, revenue-generating business models and products, are looking at tokenization to access additional capital, or boost their user base.

Unlike standard language modelling benchmarks, it distinguishes the task of predicting syntactic function words from that of predicting lower-frequency words, which carry greater semantic content. We compare a range of state-of-the-art models, each with a different way of encoding what has been previously read. We show that models which store explicit representations of long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art neural language models at predicting semantic content words, although this advantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly, we find that the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly influential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not too big and not too small, between single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful information in a text to be effectively retained and recalled.

The talk will be fairly technical.</p> <p>ABSTRACT:<br/>An agent following instructions requires a robust understanding of language and its environment. In this talk, I will propose a model for mapping instructions to actions that jointly reasons about natural language and raw visual input obtained from a camera sensor. Unlike existing approaches that decompose the problem to separately built models, our approach does not require intermediate representations, planning procedures, or training different models for visual and language reasoning. To train, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to address key problems in learning for natural language understanding, including learning in a few-sample regime and exploiting annotated training demonstrations. Our approach significantly outperforms supervised learning and common reinforcement learning methods. BIO:<br/>Yoav Artzi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Cornell Tech at Cornell University. His research focuses on learning expressive models for natural language understanding, most recently in situated interactive scenarios. He received an NSF CAREER award, best paper awards in EMNLP 2015 and ACL 2017, and a Google faculty award.
