Förra gången pratade vi ju mycket kring ramverk, och var även inne på en del kring innovation. Intressanta ämnen att att ta upp kan också vara Design Thinking och själv skulle jag gärna prata en del om krav och kravverktyg. Vi pratade också om att ta ett tag med någon annan bok, förslagen var 'Clean Architecture' eller IASA's egen 'Boken om IT-arkitektur'.

Jag tänkte prata lite om varför vi beslutade oss för att röra oss från vår gamla miljö och varför valet landade på OpenStack. På vägens gång sprang vi också på ett och annat problem och jag redogör för vad vi lärde oss av dom, samt hur vi arbetar för att undvika liknande situationer i framtiden.</p> <p>Talare: Daniel Uvehag, Acting CIO at Foundation Center for Molecular Medicine</p> <p>****</p> <p>Title: Compute node selection: understanding nova-scheduler and the placement API Description: Ever wondered how your instance ended up on this compute node and not on that other one? Nova uses a set of tools to make decisions about VM placement in an OpenStack cluster. During this presentation we will:<br/>* introduce the various components participating in the decision making: placement API, nova scheduler, host aggregates, flavors, ...<br/>* present how these components interact with each other to select the best compute host<br/>* show how you can leverage the configuration possibilities to have a better control on where VMs should be deployed. Speaker: Gauvain Pocentek, OpenSource consultant Speaker bio: I have been working with OpenStack for several years, my first mostly-working deployment being based on the Folsom Release. Since then I've had the opportunity to design, deploy and run multiple OpenStack platforms as an OpenSource infrastructure consultant for Objectif Libre, a french company based in Toulouse, Paris, and soon in Stockholm! I enjoy automating all the things, developing useful tools, and running a few kilometers before starting my work day. ****</p> <p>Titel: Building an Enterprise PaaS with OpenStack @ Elits<br/>Beskrivning: TBD<br/>Talare: Fredrik Sjöstedt, Chief Innovation Officer at Elits</p>"},{"title":"March 2018 Meetup!","date":1521734400000,"city":"Stockholm","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-RegTech-Meetup/events/247835051/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Kicking off 2018 with a great new Stockholm RegTech Meetup!</p> <p>Please register at www.eventbrite.com/e/stockholm-regtech-meetup-march-2018-tickets[masked]</p> <p>The event will be held at PA Consulting's HQ in central Stockholm.

Azure Functions introduce an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that provides a radical new approach on how you set up and run tasks, create APIs and microservices. With microservices being the focus of many organisations, Functions are a great choice for creating and running extremely scalable and performant solutions while addressing some common microservice challenges. What's even greater is that you can choose your favourite language and open source tools like Visual Studio Code or the Azure CLI to do all this. The new kid on the block is all about disrupting the traditional model for developers and enterprises and I will use this session to show you how.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Christos Matskas is a software developer, blogger, speaker and all around geek. He currently works at Microsoft as an Azure Premier Field Engineer. Before joining Microsoft, he was a successful entrepreneur and has collaborated with companies such as MarkIT, Lockheed Martin and Barclays. He's been building software for over 12 years and he's a passionate Open Source advocate.
