Presto: SQL-on-Anything","date":1520959500000,"city":"Stockholm","link":"https://www.meetup.com/stockholm-hug/events/247764427","description":"<p>IMPORTANT: This meetup is located at FooCafe and and requires an additional free signup: <a href=\"http://foocafe.org/stockholm/events/1785\" class=\"linkified\">http://foocafe.org/stockholm/events/1785</a></p> <p>• 17:45 Drink, socialize</p> <p>• 18:00 First talk: Presto: SQL-on-Anything</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. Presto was designed and written from the ground up for interactive analytics and approaches the speed of commercial data warehouses while scaling to the size of organizations like Facebook. One key feature in Presto is the ability to query data where it lives via an uniform ANSI SQL interface. Presto’s connector architecture creates an abstraction layer for anything that can be represented in a columnar or row-like format, such as HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure Storage, NoSQL stores, relational databases, Kafka streams and even proprietary data stores. Furthermore, a single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analytics across an entire organization.</p> <p>This talk will be co-presented by Wojciech Biela and Piotr Findeisen from Starburst, the enterprise Presto company, largest contributor to Presto outside of Facebook. The talk will be a gentle introduction to Presto and its ability to query virtually any data source via it’s connector interface. Wojciech and Piotr will present some of the use cases of Presto querying various data sources, discuss the existing connectors in Presto, and describe the backing architectural concepts.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>Wojciech Biela is a co-founder of Starburst and is responsible for product development. He has a background of over 13 years of building products and running engineering teams. Previously Wojciech was the Engineering Manager at the Teradata Center for Hadoop, running the Presto engineering operations in Warsaw, Poland. Prior to that, back in 2011, he built and ran the Polish engineering team, a subsidiary of Hadapt Inc., a pioneer in the SQL-on-Hadoop space. Hadapt was acquired by Teradata in 2014. Earlier, Wojciech built and lead teams on multi-year projects, from custom big e-commerce &amp; SCM platforms to PoS systems. Wojciech holds a M.S. in Computer Science from the Wroclaw University of Technology.</p> <p>Piotr Findeisen is a Software Engineer and a founding member of the Starburst team. He contributes to the Presto code base and is also active in the community. Piotr has been involved in the design and development of significant features like the cost-based optimizer (still in development), spill to disk, correlated subqueries and a plethora of smaller enhancements. Before Starburst, Piotr worked at Teradata and was the top external Presto committer of the year. Prior to that, he was a Team Leader at Syncron (provider of cloud services for supply chain management), responsible for their product's technical foundation and performance. Piotr holds a M.S. in Computer Science (and a B.Sc. in Mathematics) from University of Warsaw.</p> <p>• 18:45 Drink, socialize (even more)</p>"},{"title":"Memory DB with Product Manager","date":1520960400000,"city":"Stockholm","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Oracle/events/248183217","description":"<p>Abstract:<br/>Oracle Database In-Memory introduces a new in-memory columnar format that is compatible with all existing applications.

We used to run it on RabbitMQ and a home-built blob storage, but it was not reliable enough, had high operation costs and made onboarding new data streams difficult. Recently we have completed replacing it with new Kafka-based solution, which we does not have the above mentioned limitations.We have switched all the consumers and changed messaged format to Avro and now we are using quite a lot from Kafka ecosystem: Kafka Streams, Google PubSub connector, S3 Connector, Schema registry and Mirror Maker and soon K-SQL and Debezium. For some of the stateful consumers we had to implement backup/restore of event topics to/from S3.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Stanislav Chizhov</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Stanislav is a software engineer in Ooyala Adtech, where he develops a data delivery backbone and ecosystem with the ultimate goal to make creating and processing arbitrary data streams a commodity. He works mostly with Kafka technology stack and Java</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ivan Dyachkov</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Ivan has been leading Kafka initiative at Klarna for 3 years from the start. Right now he's a Team Lead for Servicing Reliability team and is gradually transferring ownership of Kafka infrastructure to another team.</p> <p>Title:<br/>Kafka story @ Klarna</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Our love story with Kafka at Klarna is very similar. We felt the pain of running numerous RabbitMQ clusters throughout the organization and when Kafka caught our attention we decided to try it out.<br/>Fast forward 2 years – Kafka has become a universal transport for pretty much everything. Events, metrics, database transactions – if your new service needs to produce or consume some data, the answer is always \"just use Kafka\".<br/>We'll talk about our journey with Kafka, which challenges did we have, why we reinvented some tools and what are the company-wide guidelines regarding message formats and Kafka usage.</p> <p>--------</p> <p>Special thanks to Oolaya Adtech <a href=\"http://www.ooyala.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ooyala.com/</a> who are hosting us for this event.</p> <p>Don't forget to join our Community Slack Team !<br/>If you would like to speak or host our next event please let us know!

Fredrik ger oss en introduktion till Evolutionär arkitektur, ett nytt angreppssätt på arkitekturarbete som fokuserar på att kunna förändra arkitekturen i små snabba steg och löpande utvärdera resultatet. Det blir en mix av designprinciper, konkreta exempel och kanske någon skräckhistoria från verkligheten.

Nova uses a set of tools to make decisions about VM placement in an OpenStack cluster. During this presentation we will:<br/>* introduce the various components participating in the decision making: placement API, nova scheduler, host aggregates, flavors, ...<br/>* present how these components interact with each other to select the best compute host<br/>* show how you can leverage the configuration possibilities to have a better control on where VMs should be deployed. Speaker: Gauvain Pocentek, OpenSource consultant Speaker bio: I have been working with OpenStack for several years, my first mostly-working deployment being based on the Folsom Release. Since then I've had the opportunity to design, deploy and run multiple OpenStack platforms as an OpenSource infrastructure consultant for Objectif Libre, a french company based in Toulouse, Paris, and soon in Stockholm! I enjoy automating all the things, developing useful tools, and running a few kilometers before starting my work day. ****</p> <p><br/>Titel: Building an Enterprise PaaS with OpenStack @ Elits<br/>Beskrivning: TBD<br/>Talare: Fredrik Sjöstedt, Chief Innovation Officer at Elits</p>"},{"title":"March 2018 Meetup!","date":1521734400000,"city":"Stockholm","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-RegTech-Meetup/events/247835051","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Kicking off 2018 with a great new Stockholm RegTech Meetup!</p> <p>Please register at www.eventbrite.com/e/stockholm-regtech-meetup-march-2018-tickets[masked]</p> <p>The event will be held at PA Consulting's HQ in central Stockholm.

Han har framför allt jobbat som konsult, och har därmed fått möjligheten att jobba med många olika typer av bolag och projekt.

Rasmus är ett praktexempel på hur man som utvecklare snabbt kan ta nästa steg om man vill och har rätt ambition.<br/>&lt;br&gt;Givetvis minglar vi efteråt, och vem vet, kanske letar vi efter personer med liknande ambitioner just nu.

Henrik will talk about the simple but effective method he has been using to learn from especially tricky bugs.</p> <p>He will also go through the most important lessons distilled from over 200 difficult bugs from the past 15 years. The lessons learnt are split into three categories: coding, testing and debugging.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Henrik Warne has been programming professionally for more than 20 years, and he still loves to code. He has worked on small embedded systems and large distributed systems, using a wide variety of technologies and programming languages. He is interested in all aspects of software engineering, from architecture, design and methodology to implementation, testing and debugging. He is currently a software engineer at TriOptima, developing systems for financial risk management.</p> <p>About SET</p> <p>Between 17:30 and 18.00 light snacks and drinks are served and at 18:00 the actual presentation with subsequent dialogue starts.
